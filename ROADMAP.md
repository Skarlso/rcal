# Improvements

* Implement a config which lets you decide if you want a file storage or a redis based storage
* Implement a theme picker to define your own colours
* The gem cycles through every calendar that the user has in order to list every item. But this is a very slow process. I've got to think of a better way to do this. Maybe in a parallel fetch?
